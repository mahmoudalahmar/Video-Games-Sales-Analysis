The project is about Video Games Sales Analysis, and the purpose of this project is:

1- Learning and traning more about Data Viualization by Python
2- Data Cleaning and pulling the most important variables from the dataset

And the analysis is for answering the following questions:

1- Which titles sold the most worldwide?
2- Which year had the highest sales? Has the industry grown over time?
3- Do any consoles seem to specialize in a particular genre?
4- What titles are popular in one region but flop in another?

I used the following tools to make my analysis:

1- Excel --> preview the data and understand more about it, and used pivot tables to check that is my analysis if is it parallel to my results or is there something wrong to work on it to pull the right result
2- Python --> interacting with the data by data cleaning by deleting the unessesery variables and focus of the most important variables and filtering the data frame, also data visualization which I visualize data by Bar, Line charts, and Heatmap
3- PowerBI --> Making the data visualization to make a profitional dashboard
